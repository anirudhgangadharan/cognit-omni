# COGNIT // OMNI_PRESENCE

**A Bio-Digital Interference Interface.**

## What is this?
Omni Presence is an experimental web application that visualizes the boundary between physical biological will and digital representation. It uses your webcam and microphone to drive a real-time particle physics simulation.

## How it Works
1.  **Optical Flow:** The system tracks pixel-level movement from your webcam. Your physical gestures create "wind" that pushes the digital particles.
2.  **Sonic Pressure:** The microphone analyzes sound volume. Silence creates stability; noise creates turbulence and color shifts (Redshift).
3.  **Elasticity:** Every particle tries to return to its original grid position, representing the resilience of identity against entropy.

## How to Run It
1.  Open the link.
2.  Click **"IGNITE GOD MODE"**.
3.  **Allow Permissions** for Camera and Microphone (Required for the physics engine).
4.  **Interact:**
    * **Move:** Wave your hand to disrupt the field.
    * **Speak:** Talk to see the matrix ripple.
    * **Scream:** Overload the system to trigger the Glitch State.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5 Canvas:** For high-performance particle rendering.
* **Web Audio API:** For real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) audio analysis.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Zero dependencies.
